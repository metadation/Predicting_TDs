## Predicting Pre-Snap Touchdowns

The goal of this exploratory notebook was to think about how to develop a useful, predictive play-by-play gambling model that, when provided pieces of pre-snap game data, could accurately predict whether a team would score a touchdown on that play. The dataset used for analysis and modeling was originally compiled by researchers at Carnegie Melon, and contains all regular season NFL plays from 2009-2017. With this training data, we were able to craft a model that predicts with 96% certainty whether a touchdown will be scored on any given play.
